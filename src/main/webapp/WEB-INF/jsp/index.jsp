            Assassin's Creed is an open-world action-adventure stealth video game franchise published by Ubisoft
            and developed mainly by its studio Ubisoft Montreal using the game engine Anvil and its more advanced
            derivatives. Created by Patrice DÃ©silets, Jade Raymond, and Corey May, the Assassin's Creed series depicts
            a fictional millennia-old struggle between the Assassins, who fight for peace with free will, and the
            Templars, who desire peace through order and control. The series features historical fiction, science
            fiction and fictional characters intertwined with real-world historical events and figures.
            For the majority of time players control an Assassin in the past history, while also playing as Desmond
            Miles or an Assassin Initiate in the present day, who hunt down their Templar targets. The series took
            inspiration from the novel Alamut by the Slovenian writer Vladimir Bartol, based on the historical
            Hashashin sect of the medieval Middle East,[1] while building upon concepts from the Prince of Persia series.[2]
